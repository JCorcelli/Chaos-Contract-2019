I think I can treat the text like a grid, and stop trying to turn things into rect

use a list linePositions

write the class
WorldText now I'm imagining an animated world of powerful text interaction, breaking rows to insert text, great
	List<BText>, 1 line each, all inserted text
	WordList<WordSprite>, positionless text on the margins or in the list
	
WordSprite
	position can change instantly so instead use grid
	x, y,  WorldText parent, word
	local x, local y if in parent, global x global y if not
	
write the methods to move and interact
	GetPos, XY, return World, word, char?null
	SetPos, XY, move without inserting
	Insert, XY, insert as many new lines or spaces needed
	
	LocalToGlobalXY
	GlobalToLocalXY, something's inserted to world, and world is split... so the position of something is both global and local
	
	and
	
	Linecast, step over lines to find if specific objects are interacting

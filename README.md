# Chaos-Contract-2019
I still believe Virtual Reality can be achieved

The program I wrote can significantly improve a flexibility of written 
	dialogue
	polling character action

it can poll, procedurally generate descriptions of
	events
	actions
	objects
	


The technical details are many, ultimately it's a textual system, and it is context ready for anything that can be translated to code or human-readable format.

# end-user pitch

it succeeds at imitating a camera, human memory, writing on paper, etc.

it succeeds at imitating watching a video, trying to remember, and reading from paper (respectively).

characters will do and imitate what a player expects them to, from script, to play a role in their fantasy

# ChaosGame Relevance

microverse/macroverse has been produced in "Yes" Man a language that easily describes 2d grids of gui and can reproduce a window-like environment

tech: the concepts, and existence of things are in libraries for down/up-load, preset, or learned. Respectively computers, NPC, and realtime learning (simulated by NPC among player-facing interfaces).

Containers: Reflects generic hierarchy.

Contains tech. Though containers may be outside of context and visuals, and therefor subsumed into text physics.

Location: Buildings, spawned objects, and objects are significant entities in the info layer of dialogue.

Inventory: This can be handled by combining containers and restricting removal, or replacement.

# PfoteGame Relevance

The program systems coalesce into several categories

Dialogue Physics
	Prewritten dialogue with scripting
	Prewritten events
	Finite states of the surrounding scene
	Info storage quality and simulation
		Mutating information
		Failure to remember concise or specific information
	
Player-facing Interaction
	NPC Dialogue
	Character Development
	Tutorial
	Education
	catalogs of items
	
Programming variables and virtual environment hooks that allow the game's environment to respond
	Parsing scripts within dialogue
	Scripting actions to occur as dialogue does
	Generating dialogue ahead of time for predictions, before parsing
